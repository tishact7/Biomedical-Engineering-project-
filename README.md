1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Title

Outpatient Clinic Workflow Optimization Model

2Ô∏è‚É£ Team Name

Biovolts (Tisha Chatterjee)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Challenge Chosen

Healthcare Resource Optimisation ‚Äì Option 1: Optimization algorithms for staff scheduling, room allocation, or appointment systems

4Ô∏è‚É£ Project Description

This project demonstrates a prototype for optimizing patient scheduling and resource allocation in outpatient clinics. Using a simulated dataset (clinic_simulation_log.csv), our model predicts waiting times and suggests improved scheduling to minimize delays, improve staff utilization, and enhance patient experience.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Features

Predicts potential delays using appointment and duration data.

Suggests optimized schedules to reduce bottlenecks.

Simulated dashboard shows patient flow and resource utilization.

Simple JavaScript-based prototype to showcase concept during the hackathon.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Files Included

text.js	JavaScript prototype (core logic and visualization of the model)

clinic_simulation_log.csv	(Dummy patient/clinic data used for simulation)

7Ô∏è‚É£ How to Run the Prototype

Download the project folder.

Ensure text.js and clinic_simulation_log.csv are in the same directory.

Open text.js in your preferred editor or run it through a simple HTML page with <script src="text.js"></script> included.

Use the CSV data as input for the simulation/visualization.

Refer to the demo video for guidance on using the prototype.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Technologies Used

JavaScript

Dummy data simulation (CSV)

9Ô∏è‚É£ Future Scope

Integration with hospital systems.

Use of machine learning to predict waiting times.

Expand model to multiple clinics or full hospital systems.
